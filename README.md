# TheNightForum-Game-Launcher
This is a single-file fully working Game-Launcher.
This can be used for any indie-developer game.
As this is a single-file game, it has a built-in self modification system as soon as it detects an update from the central database, over at https://github.com/TheNightForum/TheNightForum.github.io

It installs a folder in the home directory of the host machine, where it stores a complete log of what is, and has happened. It downloads the games, and keeps them up-tod-date. 

At current, this can only run java games/apps.

If I was to re-do this, I would make it interface with a RESTFUL-API in nodeJS, so then I could setup a system to post your game online, aswell as keep a download count. This would also allow me to setup a login system, so then developers could manage their games... all through the one application.


Another thing I could do, is re-do this application in electron. This would allow for a better user interface. Aswell as a greater RESTFUL-API interface.
